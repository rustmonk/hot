## About

I may or may not use this crate in the future. I'm pre-registering it regardless because crates.io is first come, first serve:

> We have had, and will continue to have, a first-come, first-served policy on crate names [0]

> We do not have any policies to define squatting, and so will not hand over ownership of a package for that reason. [1]

Note that I **am not affiliated in any way, shape, or form with the rust team or crates.io** [2]. I'm just a random unaffiliated person who likes using Rust.

I dislike bureaucracy and people dragging their feet on addressing legitimate issues.

## Fixing this issue

Email the crates io team [3]. I'm doubtful anything meaningful will happen for a while.
